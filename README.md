# SOC
A voyage to AI/ML


What I learnt:
In week 1
  First, I brushed up on the basics of Python, then learned the Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and PyTorch libraries.
  In Pytorch I got the basic idea of what a neural network is and how it work.
In week 2
  In this, we learnt about NLP, in which I learnt about Regex and how to use it in finding a specific part in text, what Word Embedding is and its different         techniques, sentiment analysis, and Text Processing.

In week 3
  I got more ideas about the neural network and clearly understood the concepts like forward pass, backproprgration, loss function, optimizers, training functions, datasets etc.

In week 4
  I learnt about what is sequential neural network is and what RNN is and its different types of architecture. Also, how to use RNN for processing the sequence of data.
